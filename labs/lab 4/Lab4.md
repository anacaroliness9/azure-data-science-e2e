# Lab 4: Detect Data Drift (preview) on datasets

In this lab you see how to monitor data drift and set alerts when drift is high. This is a new feature of Azure Machine Learning and is currently in public preview. The preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
