# Lab 0: Create a Machine Learning model to predict customer`s churn

In this lab you will configure the Azure environment to develop the Machine Learning model. We can use different Azure Service for this task (Azure Machine Learning, Azure Synapse, etc.). In this lab we will show how to use Azure Databricks to accomplish this task.

[Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pt-br/services/databricks/) allows you to build artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in an Apache Sparkâ„¢ environment in minutes, autoscale, and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace. Azure Databricks supports Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

## Microsoft Learn & Technical Documentation

The following Azure services will be used in this lab. If you need further training resources or access to technical documentation please find in the table below links to Microsoft Learn and to each service's Technical Documentation.
